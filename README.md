# COGS_108_Final_Proj

For the final project in COGS 108: Data Science in Practice, my team and I investigated the effect of accessible public green spaces on mental health in college students. We used data from an app called StudentLife which collected data on students' exercise, sleep, and mental health in Dartmouth University, from 2017 - 2020. Our hypothesis was that the more physical activity within a California college student’s daily routine – implying more time spent outdoors – the higher their levels of well-being and happiness would be, indicating greater mental health. To investigate this, we used the Spearman Correlation metric and the Mann-Whitney U Test.
