# COGS_108_Final_Proj

For the final project in COGS 108: Data Science in Practice, my team and I investigated the effect of accessible public green spaces on mental health in college students. We used data from an app called StudentLife that was launched in 2020 which collected data on students' exercise, sleep, and mental health in Dartmouth University.
